## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I was able to use React JS for an independant project and make it look as close to the design as possible. I'm completely aware that this isn't the capability of React JS , however; I'll be improving my skills throughout.

### Continued development

I'll be continuing my journey using React JS and improving on the skills I'll also try building more complex landing pages using React making use of its properties.

### Useful resources

- [React JS Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This helped me for starting out with React JS and also this helped me a lot in understanding more about the deploying techinques.
